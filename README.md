### Improvements Made

#### **Architecture Enhancements**

  - ✅ **Operational Execution**: Added `model.compile` and `model.fit` loops to make the code fully executable.
  - ✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusted `Dropout` rate from 0.5 to **0.4** and reduced output classes from 1000 to **10** for rapid convergence during demos.

#### **Dataset & Training**

  - ✅ **Synthetic Data Generation**: Implemented NumPy-based dummy data generation. This eliminates the need to download 100GB+ datasets just to verify architecture functionality.
  - ✅ **Memory Optimization**: Adjusted batch sizes to run smoothly on standard lab hardware.

#### **Why These Changes?**

  - **Portability**: The code can now be run instantly on any machine without internet access or huge downloads.
  - **Demonstration**: Proves the network architecture works mathematically without the overhead of real data processing.

**Modified Output:**

## 2\. Classification.ipynb

### Original Implementation

  - Basic Binary Classification (Cats vs Dogs).
  - Simple architecture without persistence.

### Improvements Made

#### **Architecture & Data Enhancements**

  - ✅ **Multi-Class Scaling**: Switched from binary classification to a complex **100-class Butterfly dataset**.
  - ✅ **Data Augmentation**: Implemented rotation, zooming, shearing, and flipping using `ImageDataGenerator` to prevent overfitting on the training data.
  - ✅ **Model Persistence**: Added `model.save()` functionality to persist the trained model (`model.h5`) and class indices (`.json`) for future inference.

#### **Visualization**

  - ✅ Prediction confidence scores.
  - ✅ Visual comparison of ground truth vs. predicted labels.

#### **Why These Changes?**

  - **Generalization**: Proves the model can handle complex, multi-class problems.
  - **Robustness**: Augmentation ensures the model learns features, not just memorizing pixels.

## 3\. DeepReinforcementLearning.py

### Original Implementation

  - Fixed Graph structure.
  - Hardcoded goal (Node 10).
  - Static Q-Learning pathfinding.

**Original Output:**

<img width="340" height="280" alt="deepreinforcement learning" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf2f0b2c-2de0-4b1d-8087-14433e982481" />

<img width="340" height="280" alt="deepreinforcement learning3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6735d1e-c7ce-401d-a426-8c8d7a3185a5" />

<img width="340" height="280" alt="deepreinforcement learning4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/262cc3fb-5693-414c-8ca4-ef7ca4ecb2ed" />


### Improvements Made

#### **Environment Engineering**

  - ✅ **Topology Modification**: Added a new "shortcut" edge between **Node 2 and Node 7**.
  - ✅ **Objective Change**: Changed the Goal Node from Node 10 to **Node 7**.

#### **Algorithm & Visualization**

  - ✅ **Dynamic Learning**: The Q-Learning agent successfully discovered the new shortcut `(2 -> 7)` instead of taking the long route.
  - ✅ **Enhanced Plotting**: Added descriptive titles and clearer node visualization to track the agent's logic.

#### **Why These Changes?**

  - **Proof of Learning**: By changing the map and the goal, we prove the agent is actively learning the environment rather than following a hardcoded path.
  - **Path Optimization**: Demonstrates the algorithm's ability to find the most efficient route.

## 4\. LSTM.py

### Original Implementation

  - Single LSTM layer (10 units).
  - Hardcoded Windows file path causing crashes.
  - Short look-back window (10 steps).

**Original Output:**

<img width="340" height="280" alt="op lstm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/088f08fa-b94b-4566-880f-80ad47c282d8" />
<img width="340" height="280" alt="op lstm2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c958cbd1-f358-4913-b467-03a0213824a6" />
<img width="1211" height="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f78bb9e-dc85-43f4-a285-9dc1c9da8f8b" />

### Improvements Made

#### **Architecture & Data Enhancements**

  - ✅ **Synthetic Data**: Implemented Sine Wave generation. This ensures the code runs on any computer without needing specific CSV files in specific directories.
  - ✅ **Architecture Upgrade**: Increased LSTM units from 10 to **50**.
  - ✅ **Contextual Window**: Increased `time_stamp` from 10 to **12**.

#### **Why These Changes?**

  - **Seasonality**: Since the original problem was monthly airline passengers, a 12-step window better captures the yearly cycle.
  - **Robustness**: The Sine Wave generator proves the LSTM logic works on pure mathematical patterns.

**Modified Output:**

<img width="340" height="280" alt="modified lstm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cff73c4-0e33-46d3-a6fd-80d4a1417074" />

## 5\. Rnn.py

### Original Implementation

  - SimpleRNN layer (vanishing gradient problem).
  - Short sequence length (6).
  - Basic text inputs ("Handsome boy...").

**Original Output:**

<img width="874" height="58" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f98d0be-e680-4032-8f05-f1cd6cd8ff42" />
### Improvements Made

#### **Architecture Enhancements**

  - ✅ **LSTM Upgrade**: Replaced `SimpleRNN` with **`LSTM`** to fix the vanishing gradient issue and retain long-term context.
  - ✅ **Technical Corpus**: Changed input text to "Artificial Intelligence involves machine learning..." to be more relevant to the course.

#### **Sequence Optimization**

  - ✅ **Extended Context**: Increased `seq_length` from 6 to **30**. This resolved ambiguity between repeated words (e.g., "machine *learning*" vs "deep *learning*").
  - ✅ **Intensive Training**: Increased epochs to **400** to ensure perfect memorization of the sentence.

#### **Why These Changes?**

  - **Coherence**: The LSTM with a longer window prevents the model from generating garbled or repetitive text.

**Modified Output:**

<img width="1809" height="74" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f961be4-682b-4d77-923f-630d506d861d" />

-----

## 6\. TicTacToe.py

### Original Implementation

  - 50,000 training rounds (slow).
  - Policy loading that crashed due to missing files.
  - Zero reward for draws.

**Original Output:**

<img width="321" height="914" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b201f90-394d-4e57-a2d6-4e5c205aef4e" />
<img width="321" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23c12278-0496-46d7-8db3-4339a32d9516" />


### Improvements Made

#### **Training Enhancements**

  - ✅ **Optimized Training**: Reduced rounds to **3,000** for faster execution while retaining strategy learning.
  - ✅ **Reward Logic**: Changed Tie/Draw reward from 0 to **0.2**.
  - ✅ **Self-Contained**: Disabled external file loading (`loadPolicy`) to prevent crashes.

#### **Why These Changes?**

  - **Strategic Play**: Rewarding ties teaches the agent to play defensively ("Not losing is better than losing"), which is optimal in Tic-Tac-Toe.
  - **Stability**: The script is now standalone and does not depend on pre-existing files.

**Modified Output:**

<img width="444" height="854" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01eb4e66-3182-4251-a952-be2b94eb19cc" />
